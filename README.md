## What is it?

LOICollectionA is a multifunctional plugin set for Minecraft Bedrock servers running [LeviLamina](https://github.com/LiteLDev/LeviLamina). It is a complete refactor of LOICollection, rebuilt for LeviLamina with a micro-kernel architecture: every feature lives in its own module and can be enabled or disabled from the configuration file.

Why choose it?

- **One install, many features.** Cover moderation, economy, shops, teleportation, announcements, statistics, and more without juggling a dozen plugins.
- **Modular by design.** Turn off what you don't need — modules run independently and don't interfere with each other.
- **Native UI everywhere.** Features use Bedrock's native forms through the built-in `.lcui` layer, so players get a proper in-game interface instead of chat-command-only experiences.

> This project is under active development. More API interfaces for plugin developers are planned.

## Quick Start

> Requirements: a LeviLamina server (26.20.x) with [lip](https://github.com/LiteLDev/lip) installed.

1. Run the following command in your server directory:

    ```cmd
    lip install github.com/loitietu/LOICollectionA
    ```

2. Start the server (`bedrock_server_mod.exe`).
3. Wait for the loading confirmation message in the console.

Need more? Read the [quick start guide](docs/md/start.md) (manual installation, upgrades, common issues), the [version compatibility list](docs/md/version.md), or the [data migration guide](docs/course/migrate.md).

## Developers

<details>
<summary><strong>Developer docs</strong></summary>

`.lcui` is the plugin's native UI layer. It wraps LeviLamina's form and UI capabilities — including `CustomForm`, `MessageBox`, and `PaginatedForm` — so you can build in-game interfaces with scripts instead of recompiling the plugin.

- [LCUI scripting guide](docs/md/lcui.md)
- [LOICollectionAPI reference](docs/md/api.md)
- [Development environment setup](docs/dev/config.md)

More API interfaces for plugin developers are planned.

## Build from Source

Requirements: [xmake](https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake) and a `clang-cl` toolchain.

Open Command Prompt (`cmd`) and execute:

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/loitietu/LOICollectionA.git
cd LOICollectionA
xmake repo -u
xmake
```

See the [development environment guide](docs/dev/config.md) for details.

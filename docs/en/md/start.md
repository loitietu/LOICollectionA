# Quick Start

## Installing LOICollectionA

This section is divided into two parts: `manual installation` and `lip installation`  
In most cases, it is usually recommended to use `lip installation`  
However, in some special cases, `manual installation` is quicker than `lip installation`

### lip Installation

> [!WARNING]
> Before installation, please make sure `lip` is properly installed and the server is configured

- Run the following command in the server root directory to install LOICollectionA

```bash
lip install github.com/loitietu/LOICollectionA
```

- To install a specific version, run the following command

```bash
lip install github.com/loitietu/LOICollectionA@v1.15.0
```

- To update the version, run the following command

```bash
lip install --upgrade github.com/loitietu/LOICollectionA
```

> [!TIP]
> When updating the version, please make sure whether the target version requires data migration.  
> If data migration is required, please back up the plugin data first, then find the `migrate.py` file for the corresponding version in the `scripts/migrate` folder of the `Github` repository, and perform the data migration according to the [instructions](../course/migrate.md).

- After installation, you can find the LOICollectionA installation files in the `plugins` folder
- Double-click the `bedrock_server_mod.exe` file in the server root directory to start the server
- In the server terminal, you should be able to see the LOICollection startup log
